SpaceTokens make locations first-class citizens of map interaction. (a) Four SpaceTokens (gray rectangles with rounded corners), each representing a location. SpaceTokens empower users to use locations directly to address "seeing" and "linking" problems discussed in paper. For example, users can (b) tap SpaceTokens to make corresponding locations visible; (c) drag SpaceTokens onto map, so corresponding locations snap to positions of dragged SpaceTokens; (d) hold an on-screen location (using left thumb) and tap several SpaceTokens to see their relative positions; (e) link an on-screen location to a SpaceToken using LinkTool (bubble above left thumb). LinkTools in (c--e) also serve as visible labels for locations being touched.
